# Air-quality-detector

## Overview
The Air Quality Detector is a real-time environmental monitoring system built using a Raspberry Pi and various sensors to track air quality parameters, including gas presence, temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration. The system collects and analyzes data in real-time and visualizes it on the ThingSpeak platform, allowing users to monitor environmental conditions remotely. Alerts via LEDs and buzzers are triggered when significant changes are detected, making it a reliable tool for both real-time monitoring and remote analysis.

## Objectives and Goals
1. Real-Time Data Collection: Continuously collect data on gas levels, temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration using integrated sensors.
2. Data Visualization: Visualize collected data intuitively on ThingSpeak, ensuring accessibility and clarity.
3. User Alerts and Notifications: Integrate visual and audible alerts (LEDs and buzzers) to notify users of significant changes in real-time.
4. System Robustness: Ensure the system operates reliably with thorough testing and resolution of any issues.
5. User-Friendly Interface: Provide clear and descriptive visualizations with proper labels and legends for easy interpretation.
6. Scalability and Future Integration: Design the system to be expandable for future sensor integration and enhanced monitoring capabilities.
